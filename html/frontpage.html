          <h2>HTML Elements</h2>
  
          <p>
            As in the above example, html document consists of a tree of elements and text. 
            Each element starts with a tag and ends with a tag.
             Tags have to be nested such that they are completely within each other without overlapping .

          <h2>Block Level Elements</h2>
  
          <p>
            Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line 
            following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also 
            appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page.
             For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation 
             menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't 
            be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
